# VISUALIZING THE COSMIC DAWN AND THE EPOCH OF REIONIZATION
The epoch of reionization is one of the most illusive and least know period in the history of ourUniverse. One of the direct ways to probe this epoch is via observation of the 21 cm line transitionfrom the neutral hydrogen (HI). There are several radio telescopes all around the world that aretrying observe this era through this 21 cm line.  Through a detailed observation of this era onehopes to get a better understanding of the formation of the present day complicated structures aroundus. However, once such observations are successful one would need to interpret them using variousphysical models. Various realistic simulations of reionization are continuously being developed withthe aim of understanding the physical processes that has happened during the reionization and theirimpact on the 21 cm observables from this era. In this projectIe we have used visualizations as a tool tounderstand the differences and connections between different kind of simulated reionization scenarios.Here we applied the visualization techniques to understand two specific aspects of reionization through simulations. 
* The first being the impact of different kinds of dark matter models and how they affectthe structure formation and in turn the reionization history and neutral hydrogen topology. 
  * Cold Dark matter model
  * Warm Dark matter model
* The second being the impact of different kinds of source models for the production of ionizing photons on the resulting 21 cm signal and HI topology during the EoR. Through our analysis, we find that efficient visualizations can provide us very interesting insights in to the dark matter model, source model andthe physics of reionization.
  * Fiducial mode
  * Clumping model
  * UIB dominated model
  * Power Law model
