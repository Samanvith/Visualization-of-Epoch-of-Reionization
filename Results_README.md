By comparing the reionization scenarios in 3D volume rendering shows the differences in 21 cm maps and halo structures more clearly.  Hence thereionization scenarios were rendered in 3D volume, and evolution of the 21cm BT with the cosmic time was animated. **Volume rendering attemptsto provide a global view of the data set, particularly useful to render both theexternal surfaces and the interior 3D structures with the ability to displayweak or fuzzy surfaces.  Volume rendering can be performed using ray-tracing or using the graphics card to combine a series of (semi-)transparenttexture maps**
Different dark models were used to study their effect on 21cmBT.The difference in the dark matter model scenarios clearly show throughtheir 3D halo structures and evolution of halo population.Four different source models and their effects were also observed. The halo density is fixed for every source model. The difference in 21cm BTmaps will occur only due to the sources that are responsible for reionization.
